## I ate a whole block of Cathedral City Mature Cheddar that I bought from an Aldi Shop and Go
Not because I wanted to but because this cheese makes a bold claim that it is 'The Nation's Favourite'.
Now I'm a cheese connoisseur right, my qualifications: GCSE French, so naturally I had to try this out.
The cheese isn't bad, I ate it, I ate all of it...
Whether its the nation's favourite, I'm not sure.
I may buy another block
